# mdcsvimporter2015
Moneydance plug-in to import transactions from CSV files. You can define, simply, on a screen, any number of 'Custom Readers' yourself, one for each Account file. You define the order and fields that will be imported into MD, like Date, Amount, Description, Category, etc... You can ignore fields, and specify that certain fields "Can Be Blank". You can test if a file parses properly, and have it find and list files to import that are tied by file name to a Custom Reader. You can do Regex parsing of csv files for tricky situations. And importantly, it will not import transactions that you previously imported, by doing matching. There is a How To doc you can download with an example of how to define your own custom readers.

Latest version: only from here - version right in Money Dance is: 15.7.7 at this time, so if you want the latest, get it from here.
Remove old version. Restart. Install via 'Add From File'.

The plug-in is still considered BETA, however, it works well for people who have tried it.
